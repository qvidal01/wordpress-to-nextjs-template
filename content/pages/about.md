About AIQSO
We’re a family-led AI automation company that believes technology should work for you, not the other way around. Our approach is simple: understand your workflow first, then automate what truly matters.

Our Story
AIQSO was founded on a simple observation: most businesses don’t need more technology—they need smarter technology that actually understands their operations. After 25+ years working across government infrastructure, enterprise technology, and small business operations, our founder Quinn Vidal saw the same pattern everywhere: brilliant people spending too much time on repetitive tasks that could be automated.
But here’s what we learned: automation without understanding creates more problems than it solves. That’s why we take a different approach. We start by learning your business, identifying the tasks that truly waste your time, and then implementing AI solutions that fit your workflow—not forcing you to change everything to fit the technology.
Today, we’ve helped over 200 clients across retail, IT, and professional services streamline their operations with smart automation. Every solution is custom-built because we know that what works for an auto shop won’t work for an MSP, and what works for an accounting firm won’t work for a logistics company.

Meet the Vidal Family
AIQSO is led by the Vidal family, bringing together diverse expertise in technology, operations, content creation, and digital media. This family-led structure means faster decisions, more personal service, and a genuine partnership approach with every client.

Quinn Vidal
Founder & CEO
With 20+ years of comprehensive IT experience—spanning hands-on telecommunications infrastructure deployment to enterprise cybersecurity management—Quinn brings a unique combination of technical depth and real-world implementation expertise. His career encompasses 17 years in IT security management and strategic consulting, 14 years of field technical experience (including fiber optic installation and network infrastructure deployment), and leadership roles across federal infrastructure modernization initiatives (post-9/11 telecommunications and network projects for defense and civilian agencies), Fortune 500 financial institutions (Citibank, IBM), global cybersecurity firms (Armis Security, Skybox Security, Check Point), and telecommunications carriers (Sprint, Verizon, Cox). Quinn holds multiple industry certifications including Cisco CCNA Security (with NSA/CNSS INFOSEC Professional recognition), CompTIA Security+ and Network+, Check Point Certified Security Administrator, and ITIL v3 Foundation. A CISSP candidate and certified technical instructor (A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA, ITIL), Quinn has also dedicated over a decade to technology education, developing STEM curriculum and teaching middle school students through the Generation Hope Laptop Program—where his students competed in robotics competitions and he earned recognition at the 2011 Women of Color STEM Conference for outstanding student leadership. He believes in making enterprise-grade security and complex automation accessible to organizations of all sizes.

Our Values

Understanding First
We never recommend a solution until we thoroughly understand your workflow. Cookie-cutter automation doesn’t work—we build what you actually need.

Real-World Experience
We’ve worked in your industry. We understand the challenges of retail operations, the complexity of MSP client management, and the compliance requirements of professional services. This isn’t theoretical—it’s hands-on knowledge.

Measurable Results
Every automation project should deliver clear ROI. We focus on solutions that save time, reduce errors, and improve customer satisfaction—outcomes you can measure and track.

Partnership Approach
We’re not vendors who disappear after installation. We’re partners who provide ongoing support, training, and optimization. Your success is our success.

How We’re Different
Most automation companies fall into one of two categories: they’re either highly technical but don’t understand business operations, or they understand business but lack the technical depth to build robust solutions. We bridge both worlds.
Our team has worked everywhere from large-scale federal telecommunications infrastructure projects—including critical network modernization efforts following September 11th—to Main Street auto shops. We’ve built enterprise-scale systems for Fortune 500 companies and point-of-sale integrations for family-owned restaurants. This breadth of experience means we can design solutions that are both technically sophisticated and practically useful.
We also leverage cutting-edge AI platforms like Anthropic’s Claude and robust infrastructure from Cloudflare to ensure your automation is built on proven, reliable technology. Learn more about effective AI implementation from McKinsey’s research on AI in business.

Giving Back
Beyond our client work, we’re committed to technology education and community service. Quinn has taught IT certifications to adult learners and brought STEM education to middle school students through the Generation Hope Laptop Program—some of whom went on to compete in robotics competitions. We believe in making technology accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive consultants.
